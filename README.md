# shopping-app is a virtual store created using react

Lets you choose over a list of items (from a placeholder API), filter by category, add and delete items from the cart. In the cart you can increase the quantity of a particular item. It shows you the price per item and the total. It has placeholder options to login and to checkout, still not implemented. It passes the info from the shop page to the cart page through the navbar, using react router. This can be improved using Context. The app uses Material UI for all the styling.
